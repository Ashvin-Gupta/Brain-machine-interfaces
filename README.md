Code completes the decoding of neural spikes in a primate subject during the execution of hand movements in eight distinct target directions, with the aim of predicting the corresponding x and y hand positions denoted [Hx,Hy]. 
Four classifiers were assessed: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), K-Nearest Centroid and Support Vector Machine (SVM), which were employed to identify the most probable direction. 
As a result, an angle classification accuracy of 95.25% was achieved. 
Hand velocity, V, was leveraged through linear regression analysis to predict [Hx,Hy] as a function of time, yielding a root-mean-square error (RMSE) of 18.852%.
